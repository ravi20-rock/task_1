During the data preprocessing and cleaning stage of the Titanic dataset analysis, several important insights and best practices were highlighted. It became clear that real-world datasets frequently contain incomplete, inconsistent, or irrelevant information that must be resolved prior to conducting meaningful analysis. In the case of the Titanic dataset, a considerable amount of data in the 'Cabin' column was absent, rendering it impractical for use. The most appropriate action was to eliminate the entire column, as any imputation or approximation would not be dependable given the high rate of missing data. Additionally, another prevalent issue was the existence of missing values in both numerical and categorical columns, particularly in 'Age' and 'Embarked'. To remedy this, the missing age values were replaced with the mean age of the dataset. This method is widely adopted for numerical data as it maintains the overall distribution without introducing extreme values. For the 'Embarked' column, which is categorical, the most frequently occurring category (mode) was utilized to fill in the missing entries. This technique effectively preserves the categorical distribution and prevents distortion of categorical proportions. A comprehensive check for missing values before and after imputation was crucial to ensure data integrity. It is vital to confirm that all missing data has been appropriately addressed, as unaddressed null values can result in errors or inaccuracies in subsequent analysis and modeling. This phase of the project underscored the significance of comprehending the nature of the data, making informed decisions on how to handle missing or irrelevant information, and employing standard techniques such as imputation or column removal. Effective data cleaning greatly enhanced the quality of the dataset, facilitating more accurate and reliable visualizations and statistical assessments in the subsequent stages of the analysis.
